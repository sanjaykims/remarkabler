# Changelog

## 2026-05-16

### Added
- Private lock for the whole app. When the `APP_PASSCODE` environment variable
  is set, every page and API is gated behind a lock screen. The owner unlocks
  with a passkey — fingerprint on Android, Face ID on iPhone — registered once
  per device, with the passcode as the backup / device-registration key. A
  successful unlock keeps that device open for 7 days; a "Lock" button in the
  nav locks immediately. With `APP_PASSCODE` unset the app stays fully open,
  so the lock is turned on simply by adding that one variable.

### Changed
- Insights page is simpler to read: the newest reflection is shown in full at
  the top, and each earlier reflection collapses into a tappable row showing
  its date and a short summary. All past entries are kept and still included
  in Copy/Export.
- Earlier-reflection rows now show a brief, fully visible label at a smaller
  font, instead of a cut-off sentence ending in "…".
- Each insight now gets a genuine short topic title written by Claude (2–5
  words), shown on its collapsed history row. Existing entries are
  automatically backfilled with a title the first time the page loads; the
  trimmed-opening label remains only as a fallback if titling fails.
- The Insights page is now a single uniform list of collapsed rows — the
  latest reflection is collapsed like every other entry (marked "Latest")
  and expands on tap, instead of being shown in full at the top.

### Fixed
- Times shown in the app (notebook upload time, insight generation time) were
  off by the UTC offset because UTC timestamps were parsed as local time.
  They are now displayed in the viewer's local timezone with the timezone
  name shown.
- The lock screen's passcode field showed only a numeric keypad; it now opens
  the full keyboard so passcodes with letters and symbols can be entered.
- Dates now always render in English regardless of the device's language
  setting, instead of following the browser locale (e.g. Korean).
- Voice features (Speak playback and spoken-question input) now use English
  only, instead of switching to Korean based on the text.
- The notebook upload control now uses a custom English "Choose file" button
  and file-name text, instead of the browser's native file picker whose
  label was localized (e.g. Korean) by the device.
- The Notebooks list is now a uniform list of collapsed rows (name + status),
  matching the Insights page; each row expands on tap to show the upload time
  and the delete action, instead of a wide multi-column table.
- Chat page no longer plays a noisy smooth-scroll animation through the whole
  history every time it opens. The saved conversation now jumps instantly to
  the latest message on load; the smooth scroll is kept only for messages
  sent or received during the session.

### Added
- Insights page: on demand, Claude reflects on all of your notes and your
  chat history and records what it notices about you. Each entry builds on the
  previous ones into a cumulative record, which can be exported (download as
  Markdown or copy).
- The chat box keeps an unsent draft: typing is saved and restored if the
  page reloads or the app is backgrounded.
- Voice on the Chat page: a Speak button transcribes a spoken question (via
  the browser's speech recognition), and the answer to a spoken question is
  read back aloud.
- PDF upload flow — upload a notebook PDF and Claude transcribes every page.
- Chat over all transcribed notes.
- Installable PWA with a Web Share Target: share a PDF from the reMarkable
  app directly to "Feed Claude" instead of uploading manually.
- Configurable data directory via the `DATA_DIR` environment variable, so the
  SQLite database and PDFs can live on a hosted persistent volume.
- Token-access diagnostics and force-push to the repo-split CI workflow.

### Changed
- Chat input is multi-line: Enter starts a new line; the Send button sends.
- Transcription now runs as a background job. Uploading or sharing a notebook
  returns immediately; the notebooks list shows a live `Transcribing…` status
  and refreshes itself when each notebook finishes.
- Rebuilt the app around PDF upload. The original reMarkable cloud-sync code
  was written against an `rmapi-js` API that does not exist and could never
  have worked.
- Updated `@anthropic-ai/sdk` to a version that supports PDF (`document`)
  input.
- Updated Next.js to patch a published security advisory.
- `npm start` now honors the host-provided `PORT` so the app can be hosted.

### Fixed
- Text-dense notebooks could be silently recorded with "0 pages". The
  whole-notebook transcription overflowed the model's output limit, the
  truncated reply failed to parse, and the empty result was wrongly marked
  "done". Transcription now uses a truncation-resilient delimiter format
  instead of JSON, allows a much larger response, and surfaces a clear error
  instead of a false success. The notebook list also shows the total page
  count.
- The transcription request is now streamed. With the larger output limit the
  SDK had started rejecting the request outright ("streaming is required for
  operations that may take longer than 10 minutes").
- Sharing or uploading a notebook no longer freezes the screen for the whole
  transcription. The request used to block until Claude finished (~1 minute);
  now it returns at once and transcription runs in the background.
- Notebooks interrupted by a server restart are flagged with an error on the
  next start instead of being stuck on `Transcribing…` forever.
- Share target sent the browser to the proxy-internal `localhost:8080`
  address after a successful share (`ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`); it now
  navigates using the real URL via a client-side redirect.
- Pre-existing TypeScript build errors that blocked any build.

### Removed
- Non-functional reMarkable cloud sync: the connect page, the sync API route,
  `lib/remarkable.ts`, and the `rmapi-js` dependency.

### Deployment
- Deployed to Railway with a 5 GB persistent volume mounted at `/data`.
